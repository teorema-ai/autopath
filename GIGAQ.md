### PROBLEM with xformers:
```
NotImplementedError: No operator found for `memory_efficient_attention_forward` with inputs:
     query       : shape=(128, 197, 24, 64) (torch.float32)
     key         : shape=(128, 197, 24, 64) (torch.float32)
     value       : shape=(128, 197, 24, 64) (torch.float32)
     attn_bias   : <class 'NoneType'>
     p           : 0.0
`flshattF` is not supported because:
    xFormers wasn't build with CUDA support
    dtype=torch.float32 (supported: {torch.bfloat16, torch.float16})
    Operator wasn't built - see `python -m xformers.info` for more info
`tritonflashattF` is not supported because:
    xFormers wasn't build with CUDA support
    dtype=torch.float32 (supported: {torch.bfloat16, torch.float16})
    Only work on pre-MLIR triton for now
`cutlassF` is not supported because:
    xFormers wasn't build with CUDA support
    Operator wasn't built - see `python -m xformers.info` for more info
`smallkF` is not supported because:
    xFormers wasn't build with CUDA support
    max(query.shape[-1] != value.shape[-1]) > 32
    Operator wasn't built - see `python -m xformers.info` for more info
    unsupported embed per head: 64
```
### Potential FIX (Gemini):
Reinstall xformers with CUDA-enabled PyTorch:
Ensure you have the correct PyTorch version installed that's compatible with your desired CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 11.8 or 12.1), according to Stack Overflow.
Uninstall your existing xformers installation: pip uninstall xformers.
Install xformers using the appropriate PyTorch CUDA wheel: pip3 install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 (for CUDA 11.8) or pip3 install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124 (for CUDA 12.4), according to Reddit.
Verify the installation by checking if torch.cuda.is_available() returns True
### IMPL:
* check cuda version
import torch
torch.version.cuda
'12.4'
* uninstall xformers
pip uninstall xformers
* reinstall xformers
pip install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
#### this will reinstall torch to 2.5.0, among other things, 
#### and seems to mess with torchvision, so
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
